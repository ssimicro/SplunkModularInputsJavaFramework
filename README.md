## Splunk Java Modular Inputs v1.0

# IMPORTANT NOTE :

Although this framework is fully functional and stable, since it was released Splunk have now created their own Java Modular Inputs librarys.
So I recommend that you use the formally Splunk developed and supported offering that can be found here : http://dev.splunk.com/view/java-sdk/SP-CAAAER2

## Overview

This is a framework for building <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/AdvancedDev/ModInputsIntro">Splunk Modular Inputs</a> in Java

It contains several example Modular Inputs that you can use as a practical reference to follow.
